# Mac Connect

Welcome to the official download page of Mac Connect!

## Why is this project not in the Mac App Store?

Since 2012, the Mac App Store requires all apps to be *sandboxed*. This means, that they are restricted to perform actions, which do not directly affect other apps or the system. Since this app needs to send *key presses* to the system, it requires not to be sandboxed. Because of that, it is not possible for us to submit this app to the Mac App Store.

Drag Mac Connect to your Applications folder. Locate macconnect-mac in your Applications and start it. You should receive a warning. This is normal, because you downloaded the app from Github, and not the Mac App Store. To start the app, confirm the warning message.

Having started the app, you will see it in the menu bar. Read your code and start your iOS Mac Connect App. You are now ready to connect.

## Troubleshooting

Although we put great efforts in network stability, their is the rare possibility of devices not finding each other. Try restarting the iOS App, then try restarting the mac App. If the problem still exists, you can e-mail us via `contact@philippmatth.es` or [file an issue report](https://github.com/PhilippMatthes/macconnect-download/issues).

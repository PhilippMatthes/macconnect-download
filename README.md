# Mac Connect

Welcome to the official download page of Mac Connect!

## Why is this project not in the Mac App Store?

Since 2012, the Mac App Store requires all apps to be *sandboxed*. This means, that they are restricted to perform actions, which do not directly affect other apps or the system. Since this app needs to send *key presses* to the system, it requires not to be sandboxed. Because of that, it is not possible for us to submit this app to the Mac App Store.
